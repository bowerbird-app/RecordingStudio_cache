# Recording Studio kit pin update

Copied addons now start on the Support host-kit floor.

- Gemspec: `add_dependency "recording_studio", "~> 4.2"`
- Dummy GitHub tags: Recording Studio `v4.4.0`, Accessible `v0.13.0`, Root Switchable `v0.5.1`, FlatPack `v0.1.196`
- Root and dummy Rails locks both `8.1.4`
- Authenticated dummy layout: `RecordingStudio::UsesDefaultLayout` plus FlatPack CSS/JS
- Hooks and BaseService come from core; do not copy them into a new addon
- Recordable declarations remain required
- RecordingStudioCache is headless: no example capability, no engine UI mount, no addon pages migration.
